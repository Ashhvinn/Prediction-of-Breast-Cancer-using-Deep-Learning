## **Introduction**
Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. This project focuses on building a robust **deep learning model** using CNN to identify different types of breast cancer from ultrasound images. By automating the diagnosis process, we aim to assist radiologists in making faster and more accurate decisions.

---

## **Project Objectives**
- Develop a CNN model to classify breast ultrasound images into:
  - **Benign** (non-cancerous)
  - **Malignant** (cancerous)
  - **Normal**
- Achieve high classification accuracy using deep learning techniques.
- Provide insights through visualizations like confusion matrices and classification reports.

---

## **Features**
- **Automated Image Preprocessing**: Images are resized, normalized, and augmented for optimal model performance.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Uses a custom CNN architecture with multiple layers for feature extraction.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
- **Scalability**: The project can be extended to include other medical imaging datasets and different cancer types.

---

## **Dataset Information**
- **Source**: [BUSI with GT Dataset](https://scholar.cu.edu.eg/?q=afahmy/pages/dataset) (Breast Ultrasound Images with Ground Truth)
- **Classes**: Benign, Malignant, and Normal
- **Dataset Size**: 1765 images divided into three categories.

### **Sample Dataset Loading Code:**
```python
dataset = tf.keras.preprocessing.image_dataset_from_directory(
    "/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset_BUSI_with_GT",
    seed=123,
    shuffle=True,
    image_size=(256, 256),
    batch_size=32
)
```

---


## **Model Architecture**
The model is designed with the following layers:
- **Input Layer**: Accepts images of size `(256, 256, 3)`.
- **Convolutional Layers**: Extract features using filters of various sizes.
- **Pooling Layers**: Reduces dimensionality while retaining important features.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Combines extracted features for final classification.
- **Output Layer**: A softmax layer with 3 nodes for the three classes.

### **Model Summary Code:**
```python
model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(256, 256, 3)),
    layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)),
    layers.Flatten(),
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(3, activation='softmax')
])
model.summary()
```

## **Results and Analysis**
- **Accuracy**: Over 90% test accuracy achieved.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Demonstrates the modelâ€™s capability in correctly classifying each category.

---

## **Challenges and Solutions**

### **Challenges**
- **Class Imbalance**: Certain classes had fewer images, leading to skewed results.
- **Overfitting**: The model tended to overfit on the training dataset.

### **Solutions**
- **Data Augmentation** helped balance the dataset.
- **Early Stopping** and **Dropout Layers** were implemented to prevent overfitting.

---

## **Future Enhancements**
- **Multi-modal Data Integration**: Combine ultrasound images with other diagnostic data like mammograms.
- **Transfer Learning**: Use pre-trained models like **ResNet** or **VGG** for better accuracy.
- **Web Application**: Deploy the model as a web service for real-time breast cancer diagnosis.
